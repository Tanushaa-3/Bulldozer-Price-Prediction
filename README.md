# 🏗️ Bulldozer Price Prediction
This project aims to build a regression model that predicts the sale price of bulldozers based on various machine, auction, and operational attributes. It uses structured tabular data and applies machine learning to estimate equipment value at the time of sale.

📂 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes features such as:

Machine Details: ModelID, MachineID, YearMade, ProductSize, Engine_Horsepower, etc.

Usage Metrics: MachineHoursCurrentMeter, UsageBand

Auction Details: SalesID, saledate, auctioneerID, state

Technical Specifications: Drive_System, Transmission, Hydraulics, Blade_Type, Track_Type, etc.


📈 Project Steps
1.Data cleaning and preprocessing

2.Feature engineering (handling categorical variables, missing values)

3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

4.Model training and evaluation

5.Final prediction and result interpretation
